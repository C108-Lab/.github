# C108-Lab

**Curated collection of Python utilities for developers.**

C108-Lab is the home of the `c108` suite of Python packages — a collection of carefully designed utilities 
that make Python development more productive and enjoyable.

##  Packages

### Core Package
- **[REF-1](https://github.com/C108-Lab/c108)** - Essential utilities: CLI helpers, I/O tools, 
  filesystem operations, validation, and more

### Extension Packages  
- Coming soon...

##  Installation

```bash
# Core utilities
pip install ref-1

# Individual extensions
pip install ref-1-...
```

## Intentions

C108-Lab packages are:
- **Curated** - Centrally developed and maintained for consistency
- **Production-ready** - Thoroughly tested and documented
- **Dependency-conscious** - Core package stays lightweight; extra features and heavy deps live in sub-packages
- **Community-friendly** - Issues and feature requests are welcome

##  Community

While we don't accept pull requests, we actively welcome:
-  **Bug reports** 
-  **Feature requests**
-  **Documentation feedback**
- ❓ **Usage questions**

##  License

All packages are released under the MIT License.
